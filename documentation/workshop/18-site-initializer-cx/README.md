## Practice

Cope all content created in previous exercises from [site-initializer](../../../modules/devcon-site-initializer/src/main/resources/site-initializer) folder in `devcon-site-initializer` folder to [site-initializer](../../../client-extensions/devcon-site-initializer-cx/site-initializer) folder in `devcon-site-initializer-cx` Client Extension.

_**Note**: you can also copy content from Complete Example: [site-initializer](../../complete-example/devcon-site-initializer/src/main/resources/site-initializer)_
